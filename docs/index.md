# About

This blog explores socialist planning proposals and the strongest arguments for and against them. The point of view articulated here can be summarized in three points:

1. Critiques of capitalist social relations lose their force without appeal to some vision of socialist planning.
2. There is no vision of socialist planning that is both widely shared and compelling.
3. The strongest arguments against the feasibility and desirability of the best models of socialist planning are much weaker than is commonly supposed.

I hope that this blog will play some small part in helping a new generation articulate socialist programs adequate to the grave political and ecological crises of our times.
