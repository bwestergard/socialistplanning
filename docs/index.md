# About

How would a socialism achievable in our lifetimes actually work? This blog explores the arguments for and against specific proposals.

Critiques of capitalist social relations lose their force without appeal to some vision of socialist planning. Today, though "socialism" is an increasingly popular ideal, there is no vision of socialist planning that is both widely shared and compelling. This despite the fact that the strongest arguments against the feasibility and desirability of socialist planning are much weaker than is commonly supposed.

I hope that this blog will play some small part in helping a new generation articulate socialist programs adequate to the grave political and ecological crises of our times.
